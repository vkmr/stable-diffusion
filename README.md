# stable-diffusion
In this guide, I will show how to generate novel images based on a text prompt using multiple implementation of stability.ai's text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion.

Stable Diffusion is a powerful, open-source text-to-image generation model. While there exist multiple open-source implementations that allow you to easily create images from textual prompts, 

1. KerasCV implementation: KerasCV's offers a few distinct advantages. These include XLA compilation and mixed precision support, which together achieve state-of-the-art generation speed. 

2. HuggingFace implementation:

3. Intel PyTorch implementation:

4. Intel OpenVINO implementation:
