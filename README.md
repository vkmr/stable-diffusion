# stable-diffusion
In this guide, I will show how to generate novel images based on a text prompt using multiple implementation of stability.ai's text-to-image model, [Stable Diffusion]([https://link-url-here.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752))

Stable Diffusion is a powerful, open-source text-to-image generation model. While there exist multiple open-source implementations that allow you to easily create images from textual prompts, 

1. [KerasCV](https://keras.io/guides/keras_cv/generate_images_with_stable_diffusion) implementation: KerasCV's implementation offers a few distinct advantages. These include XLA compilation and mixed precision support, which together achieve state-of-the-art generation speed on NVIDIA GPUs.  

2. HuggingFace implementation:

3. Intel PyTorch implementation:

4. Intel OpenVINO implementation:
